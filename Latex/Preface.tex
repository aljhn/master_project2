\chapter*{Preface}

The following project and report was completed for the master project in engineering cybernetics. It consists of an individual scientific research project aimed at learning about a chosen specialized field. A literature review of the field is done by reading scientific articles and combining it with previous theoretical knowledge. Multiple experiments are conducted to reproduce and verify results, as well as answer new research questions. The master project functions as a way to gain familiarity with the scientific method, along with producing original research and advancing the field.

I would like to thank my supervisor Adil Rasheed for his guidance and feedback during the project work.
